The purpose of the project is learning. Because defining infrastructure in a imperative way does not work in a team, I choose to do the whole course in a declarative way.

Final purpose: A Wordpress website into a Kubernetes cluster that has a chatbot with Ollama running locally, and a Mysql database for storing. Lambda for webhooks in Slack 

Uses modules as a main structure for files, variables and outputs.
