Architecture

1. AWS services Integration with EKS
Fundamentals:
Imperative:
	kubectl,             ->  Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service
Declarative:
	YALM&Kubectl ->  Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service

Because Kubernetes resources are declarative and self-healing:
A Pod will wait and retry until its referenced ConfigMap or Secret exists.
A Service can exist before the Pods it selects ‚Äî it just won‚Äôt have endpoints yet.
A Deployment can create its ReplicaSet even before the Service exists ‚Äî they‚Äôre loosely coupled via labels.
Type	                                     Recommended order	Why  # the order of creation of resources
Namespaces	                                ü•á First	Everything else lives inside them
RBAC (Roles, RoleBindings, ServiceAccounts)	ü•à Second	Pods and controllers might need permissions
ConfigMaps / Secrets	                    ü•â Third	Pods reference them
Services / Deployments / StatefulSets	    üèóÔ∏è Fourth	Core workloads
Ingress / NetworkPolicy	                     üï∏Ô∏è Last	Depend on running Services and Pods

You can apply them all at once ‚Äî Kubernetes will eventually reconcile the correct state ‚Äî but applying them in this logical order avoids transient ‚ÄúNotFound‚Äù warnings.


CLI's:  AWS CLI - control multiple AWS services though command line and automate though scripts. Manages the cluster
kubectl - manages the cluster and objects
eksctl - manages the clusters and objects / create and delete clusters on AWS EKS, create Autoscale and delete node groups, create Fargate profiles.

Moving worker nodes to private subnets is a best practice and Load Balancer to public subnets !!!! WHY!!!!

aws ec2 describe-vpcs     # fetches VPCs under aws confidure account

EKS Cluster made out of ( In EKS the following it is managed by AWS):
EKS Control Plane
	It is the Master Node in regular Kubernetes Achitecure - It hosts etcd, kube api server, kubectl (kube controller)
	EKS Control Plane - Eks runs a single tenant (user) K8s control plane for each cluster and control plane infrastructure
	This control plane consists of at least two API server nodes and three etcd nodes that run across three availability zone within a region - You are not sharing etcd or API server with other AWS users on AWS infrastructure.
	Each EKS cluster has its own isolated control plane even though you do no manage the servers directly ( etcs, controller manager, scheduler kube-apiserver (all kubectl/eksctl calls go there))
	Eks auto detects and replaces unhealty control plane instances, restarting them across AZ-s within a region as needed.
	Three etcd nodes across three Availability Zones‚Äù
	etcd is critical ‚Üí it stores all Kubernetes cluster state.
	AWS deploys 3 etcd nodes (minimum), one in each Availability Zone (AZ) in the region.
	This forms a quorum (majority voting system):
	Even if one AZ goes down, 2 etcd nodes remain ‚Üí cluster keeps running. Ensures durability and fault tolerance.

	
Worker Nodes/Node Groups
	Group of EC2 instances that run the apps - deploy our k8 apps
	AMI-s are specifiically designed for K8 AWS
	EKS worker nodes running in our AWS account and connect to our cluster's control plane via the cluster API server endpoint - This cluster server API endpoint should be exposed to the internet and can be used to comunicate with our VPC
	A node group is one or mode EC2 instances that are deployed   in an EC2 Autoscalling group
	Worker machines in k8 = nodes (ec2 instances)
	All instances ina a node group must have the same: Instance Type, AMI, KES worker node IAM role


Fargate Profiles/Serverless - Fargate runs only on PRIVATE subnets
	CPU,RAM is abstracted away and is autoscalable - you pay what you use
    Each pod running on Fargate has its own isolation boundary - kernel, CPU, Memory, elastic network with another pod

On demand, rightsized compute capacity for containers
    AWS specially build Fargate controllers that recognizes the pods belonging to fargate and chedules them on Fargate profiles
    Does not share underlying resources ( CPI, mem, etc)


VPC
	Security comes from the design of the VPC - You can delpoy to private or public subnets
	Fargate runs only on PRIVATE subnets!
	If you deploy apps to private subnets in worker nodes (ec2 or Fargate) we neet to setup comunication with the control plane with:
	A **NAT Gateway** (in a public subnet) ‚Üí gives them outbound internet.
    Or **EKS Private Endpoint** (VPC endpoint for the control plane).
    EKS uses AWS VPC network policies to restrict traffic between control planet components to within a single cluster 
    Control plane components for a EKS cluster cannot view or receive communication from other clusters or other AWS accounts except as authorized with Kubernetes RBAC policies
    This kind of configuration is secure and highly available - EKS is reliable and very good for production workloads



2. DevOps
Pipeline for apps and also for Kubernetes manifest:

If you make any change to Kubernetes manifest and check that core it will be deployed to you K8s cluster. Same for applications, they will get build a new Docker image and deploy it to the K8s cluster. 

3. Microservices

Service discovery
Distribuited Tracing 
Canary Deployments

NameSpaces:

The `dev` and `prod` namespaces exist in the **same cluster** but manage **different sets of resources**.  
> Resources in one namespace are not visible in the other.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Namespace: dev
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deployment: web-app
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pod: web-app-123
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: web-svc
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ConfigMap: app-config
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Namespace: prod
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deployment: web-app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pod: web-app-456
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: web-svc
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ConfigMap: app-config

Clusters are **completely independent** of one another.  
> Even if namespaces share the same name (e.g. `dev`), they belong to **different clusters** and cannot access each other's resources.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Namespace: dev
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deployment: api-server
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: api-svc
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Namespace: staging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Deployment: web-ui
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Service: ui-svc


OIDC - Open ID connect

Humans have IAM accounts

Service accounts let resources (not humans ) comunicate like pods to authenticate to the API or authenticate to cloud services via OIDC/IRSA in AWS / Service Accounts = identities for workloads (pods, controllers, jobs), not for humans.

Both from above must respect RBAC rules to decide what they can do

- Pod runs in EKS with a **Service Account**.
    
- EKS issues a **JWT** for that SA (signed by EKS OIDC provider).
    
- Pod presents JWT to AWS STS (IAM Security Token Service).
    
- AWS IAM checks:
    
    - Is this JWT signed by a trusted OIDC provider (your EKS cluster)?
        
    - Does it match the IAM role trust policy?
        
- If yes ‚Üí IAM gives the pod **temporary AWS credentials**.
    
- Now the pod can access AWS resources securely.

OIDC = a **way to log in** (authentication) that apps and systems can use to trust each other without storing passwords or static keys.

- OAuth2 ‚Üí ‚ÄúCan this app act on your behalf?‚Äù (authorization).
    
- OIDC ‚Üí ‚ÄúWho is this user/app really?‚Äù (authentication)


In AWS EKS:

- Your cluster acts (is) as the an **OIDC Identity Provider**.
	-The **EKS control plane** has an **OIDC endpoint** (your cluster‚Äôs OIDC provider).
    
	-When a pod starts, Kubernetes mounts a token into it at:
    
    `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`
    
- That token is a **JWT signed by the cluster‚Äôs OIDC provider**.
    
- Pods get OIDC **JWT tokens** tied to their Kubernetes Service Accounts.
    
- AWS IAM is configured to **trust** that OIDC provider.
    
- Result: Pods can use their JWTs to assume IAM roles ‚Üí access AWS resources.# In AWS EKS

- Pods get OIDC **JWT tokens** tied to their Kubernetes Service Accounts.
    
- AWS IAM is configured to **trust** that OIDC provider.
    
- Result: Pods can use their JWTs to assume IAM roles ‚Üí access AWS resources.

- The **EKS control plane** has an **OIDC endpoint** (your cluster‚Äôs OIDC provider).    


How does the token know it belongs to the Service Account?

It‚Äôs inside the **JWT payload**

Example decoded JWT from a pod:

{
  "iss": "https://oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE1234",
  "sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:s3-writer",
  "kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/namespace": "default",
  "kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-account.name": "s3-writer",
  "exp": 1738927347,
  "aud": "sts.amazonaws.com"
}


Look at the key parts:

- `"sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:s3-writer"` ‚Üí this says: **token belongs to Service Account `s3-writer` in namespace `default`**.
    
- `"iss"` ‚Üí who issued it (your EKS OIDC provider).
    
- `"aud"` ‚Üí who this token is for (in IRSA it‚Äôs AWS STS).
    

So the binding happens because the **JWT itself encodes the Service Account name + namespace**.

JSON Web Token

1. The JWT is **digitally signed** by the OIDC provider (your cluster).
    
2. AWS IAM knows the provider‚Äôs **public key** (from when you did `eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider`).
    
3. IAM verifies the signature ‚Üí proves the JWT really came from your cluster.
    
4. IAM checks the **claims** (like `sub`) against the IAM Role trust policy.
    
    - Example condition in trust policy:
        
        "Condition": {
  "StringEquals": {
    "oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/EXAMPLE:sub": "system:serviceaccount:default:s3-writer"
  }
}


That line literally says: _‚ÄúOnly accept tokens tied to Service Account `s3-writer` in namespace `default`.‚Äù_
    
- Pods get tokens automatically mounted.
    
- The JWT explicitly contains the **Service Account identity** (`sub` claim).
    
- The OIDC provider signs it.
    
- AWS IAM trusts the signature and matches the `sub` to the Service Account you allowed in the trust policy.
    

The tokens are **tied to Service Accounts because the JWT contains the SA name + namespace in its claims, and the signature ensures it can‚Äôt be faked.**


So, EKS control plane has an OIDC provider that has and endpoint though which a JWT

This path is located in the pod where each JWT ( Json Web Token)
kubectl exec -it mypod -- sh
ls /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
you may see : ca.crt  namespace  token

**For example this command :**
**eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider  # does not create pod tokens, instead it registers cluster OIDC endpoint in IAM so later when pods are created and present tokens, IAM knows how to validate them - This is a one setup of trust**
**When is the OIDC JWT actually created?**
**When a Pod is created, Kubernetes assigns it a Service Account ( default or custom )** # Never create a pod by itself - must create a daployment or whatever resource you want
**The kubelet on the node automatically requests a token for that Service Account from the EKS control plane**
**The token will be signed by the EKS OIDC provider -> It contains: service account name, namespace, audience, expiry**
**The token is mounted inside the pod at : ls /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token**

**Verify service accounts in cluster : kubectl get sa -n default**

Docker

Docker solves the problems 
Installation and configuration - LIbraries and dependencies, operating sistems, hardware infra - all of this becomes reproducable with docker images. Inconsistencies across envs. In Docker you can leverage all of them at once. Developer environments are provisioned imediately by spinning up necessary requirements.txt

Virtual machines achitecture using Docker :

Hardware infra -> Hypervisor -> Multimple Docker containers -> Operating Sys -> Llibraries, Dependencies, webservers, databases, envs etc

Physical machines architecture using Docker:
Hardware -> Operating Sys -> Docker - > Containers

Advantages: Flexible, Lightweight, Portable, Loosely coupled (self sufficient, upgrade one without affecting others),Scalable (more repicas accross a datacenter), secure (aggresive constraints)

Achitecture - Docker Terminology

Docker Daemon:
	Inside DockerHost we install Docker Daemon (dockerd) -> listens for Docker PI requests and manages Docker Objects such as images, containers, networks, volumes

Docker Client:
	Docker client can be present on either Docker Host or any other machine
	The Docker client (docker) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker - When docker run, the client sends these commands to dockerd (docker Daemon) which executes
	Docker commands use Docker API
	Docker client can comunicate with more that one Daemon

Docker Images:
	An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker image
	Docker images can be based on another image with additional customization (you can add to other images and make it your own custom)
	We can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it. 
	When a container is removed, any changes to its state that are not stored will dissapear



Docker host -> Docker Daemon 
If you want to pull and image -> we use Docker client (docker pull nginxdemo/hello) -> then Docker client comunicates with Docker Daemon on the Docker Host -> Then Daemon goes to Docker registry -> downloads to Docker images -> when docker run -p 80:80 -d nginxdemos/hello it runs the image in the container -> Run the image and test it -> then you can push it to the registry

Docker registry is a public image registry where you find images
You can push back to a Docker registry ( some are with payment )


Running docker images - from dockerhub

docker version
docker login -u plasticmemory
docker info | grep Username # to see which user you are logged
cat ~/.docker/config.json  # to get the json login token
docker pull /repository/imagename:tagnameMandatoryVersion0.0.0.0Release
docker run --name containername -p 80:8080 -d imagename:tagMandatoyAgain

If port conflicts exist then : sudo lsof -i :80  # or insert the port number that is in conflict to see what is running on the sys outside the docker or other tools that you are trying to use
docker run --name appcontainername -p 80:8080 -d "stacksimplify/dockerintro-springboot-helloworld-rest-api:1.0.0-RELEASE" 
docker ps -a -q # to list container ID only 
docker ps -q  # to list only running containers and only ID

docker logs  # this lists whatever has been executed in the container including the endpoint
Executing inside the container:
	docker exec -it 933d0f72e445 sh  # to access the shell. It does not have bash installed ( image has alpine linux very slim )
	cat /etc/os-release # to see which operating sys
	du -sh /  # to see total used container memory
	du -h -d1 / # total and folders only on level 1 of depth
	ps -ef # list running processes in the container  -e system wide processes, -f full format ( ppID, user, command path)
	ping 8.8.8.8  # to see network connectivity


curl http://localhost:8081/hello; echo # from outside the container
docker inspect containerid
docker inspect -f '{{json .Config.ExposedPorts}}' containername
docker inspect container name | grep IPAddress
docker ps -a --size # check how much the containers are using
docker system df # check docker usage
docker system prune # WARNING this deletes unused containers
docker ps -a --size # see each container how much mem is using
docker top containername

docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' containerID  # gets you the IP from nerworks

Building and pushing docker images - to dockerhub

docker login -u username # be shure to be logged
create folder for project or navigate where needed
create Dockerfile with everything that will be moved into the image
docker build -t username/imagename:v1  # or whatever tag you need
docker run -t --name choosecontainername -p 81:80 -d username/imagename:v1
Let's say you make modifications to the image and want a v2 and then a release version to upload to dockerhub:
docker tag imagenameV1 imagenameV2-release
both have same ID and changes are tracked similar to how github does
all versions will be uploaded to dockerhub
docker push plasticmemory/nginx-customimage:v2-release

	is the frontend for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API
	Handles the CLI tools like kubectl, Users and even Master components ( scheduler, controller manager, etcd), Worker node components like kubelet
etcd
	Consistent, highly available key value store used as kubernetes backing store for all cluster data
	It sotres all the masters and worker node info
KubeController manager
	Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes, containers or endpoints go down
	
	Node controller notices when nodes go down
	Replication controller maintains the correct number of pods for every app
	Endpoints controller populates the endpoints object( joins services and pods)
	Service account and Token controller - service account creation and API access for new namespaces

CloudController manager
	Cloud controller manager is responsible for Cloud specific architecture - it embeds cloud specific logic
	Local Kubernetes does not have this component.
	It only runs controllers that are specific to you cloud provider
	Node controller chekcs if a node has been deleted in the cloud anfter is stops responding ( if it was deleted from the cloud then it will auto delete from the k8s cluster)
	Service controller creates, updates and deletes cloud provider load balancer

**Kubelet** agent:  it **communicates with the API server**, gets the desired Pod specs, and ensures those containers are running using the container runtime (like containerd or CRI-O).
kubelet is the primary node agent in Kubernetes
It communicates with the API server to receive Pod definitions and ensures that the required containers are running, healthy, and match their desired state.  
It also reports node and Pod status back to the control plane.

**Kube-proxy** is a network proxy that runs on each node.  
It maintains network rules that allow communication **to and from Pods**,  
ensuring connections **inside the cluster (Pod-to-Pod)** and **from outside the cluster (via Services)** work correctly.
sits on Layer 4 TCP/UDP
kube-proxy doesn‚Äôt modify Pods directly; it maintains **network rules on the node**, not _inside_ Pods.
**kube-proxy** is a network component that runs on every node

EKS kubernetes - VS kubernetes  - Comparing the Master Nodes

Kubernetes Fundamentals

Pod is a single instance of your app and is the smallest object in K8s
ReplicaSet will maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time - it guarantees the availibility of the identical Pods
A Deployment runs multiple replicas of you application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive. Does handle roll-out and roll-back changes to apps. Deployments are good for statelss applications. Stateless apps do not remember theys past state. They mostly send data to other apps, and not store themselves. 
Service sits in front of one or more Pods and **acts as a built-in load balancer**, distributing traffic evenly among them.
Service practically sits in front of a POD and acts as a load balancer

EKS commands for cluster creation and checking

eksctl create cluster --name=eksdemo1 \
                      --region=us-east-1 \
                      --zones=us-east-1a,us-east-1b \
                      --without-nodegroup 

aws eks update-kubeconfig --name eksdemo1 --region us-east-1

The above command is the moment that we switch from AWS infrastructure creation to Kubernetes API (kubectl )writes to the k8s API that interacts with EKS cluster 
by running the above command the following gets created for local Kubernetes:
  adds a new cluster entry (endpoint + certificate),
  adds a user entry (with AWS IAM exec plugin),
  adds a context entry (that links the two),
  and marks that context as current.
  
kubectl config current-context # checkout if autoswitched to cluster
to check this out.
eksctl get cluster  
kubectl get svc


 OIDC - a **way to log in** (authentication) that apps and systems can use to trust each other without storing passwords or static keys.
```
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \   
    --region region-code \
    --cluster <cluster-name> \
    --approve

 Replace with region & cluster name
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --cluster eksdemo1 \

How to check if this resource exists: 
    aws s3 ls --region us-east-2 | grep mlops-tofu-state
    Should return date/time/name of resource

DynamoDB check:
    aws dynamodb list-tables --region us-east-2
    should return a json with name

terraform outputs:
Should return:
    tf_state_bucket = "mlops-tofu-state"
    tf_locks_table  = "mlops-tofu-locks"


CLI VPC check
    aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region us-east-2 --query "Vpcs[].{ID:VpcId,CIDR:CidrBlock}"

CLI get Subnets
    aws ec2 describe-subnets --region us-east-2 --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-0aae990c4109f5877" \
    --query "Subnets[].{ID:SubnetId,CIDR:CidrBlock,AZ:AvailabilityZone}"

CLI get NAT gateways
    aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --region us-east-2 --filter "Name=vpc-id,Values=vpc-0aae990c4109f5877" \
    --query "NatGateways[].{ID:NatGatewayId,Subnet:SubnetId,State:State}"

DEFINING resources ( EKS transition to kubectl)

A namespace is just a logical grouping of K8s resources that represent a virtual cluster within a physical cluster
It is used to organize, isolate and manage resources such as Pods, Services, and Deployments that belong to the same application, team, environment.
Each namespace can have: 
	its own resource quota
	access controls RBAC
	own network policies
General usage of namespaces:
	default - general workloads
	dev - deveopment environment
	staging - pre-production testing
	prod - production workloads
	kube-system - system components like CoreDNS, KubeProxy, etc


A context is a connection configuration - it tells kubectl which cluster to talk to and which user and in which namespace by default
Bellow a yaml showing this:

contexts:
 -name: arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:716969406947:cluster/mlops-infra-aws-eks
   context:
    cluster: arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:716969406947:cluster/mlops-infra-aws-eks
    user: arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:716969406947:cluster/mlops-infra-aws-eks
    namespace: default

kubectl config current-context 
kubectl config create-context 
kubectl config use-context contextname # to switch to other context names

examples of used commands to clear a cluster:
kubectl config delete-context arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:716969406947:cluster/mlops-infra-aws-eks
kubectl config delete-cluster arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:716969406947:cluster/mlops-infra-aws-eks
kubectl config unset users.arn:aws:eks:us-east-2:716969406947:cluster/mlops-infra-aws-eks
kubectl config delete-user my-user

kubectl config unset current-context

In the case of users, if a user is deleted or unset, kubectl removes the authentication data : tokens, certifications or AWS IAM exec plugin for that user. Any attempt to connect will fail. The cluster itself is untouched.
kubectl config unset users.username  deletes the local auth data for that user.


aws eks commands and kubectl
aws credentials must be setup in aws configure in order to use aws configure
These two tools are used for administration.
With aws eks commands you are creating and configuring the cluster.
aws eks create-cluster \   # this creates the control plane, api server, etcd, controllers but no worker nodes yet
  --name my-cluster \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/EKS-ClusterRole \
  --resources-vpc-config subnetIds=subnet-abc123,subnet-def456,securityGroupIds=sg-0011223344
  
You can check the progress with this command:
	aws eks describe-cluster --name my-cluster --region us-east-2
	
You can add nodegroups that will run the pods 
aws eks create-nodegroup \
  --cluster-name my-cluster \
  --nodegroup-name my-node-group \
  --subnets subnet-abc123 subnet-def456 \
  --scaling-config minSize=1,maxSize=3,desiredSize=2 \
  --ami-type AL2_x86_64 \
  --instance-types t3.medium \
  --node-role arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/EKS-NodeInstanceRole
You can check the nodegroup status:
aws eks describe-nodegroup --cluster-name my-cluster --nodegroup-name my-node-group

After the nodes are ready we can connect our local machine and use kubectl
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-2 --name my-cluster
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get namespaces

kubectl create namespace dev
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl get pods -n dev
kubectl expose deployment myapp --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
From this point forward, **you‚Äôre no longer using `aws eks`** ‚Äî everything happens through the **Kubernetes API** via `kubectl`

A diagram to understand where the shift to kubectl is made:
[ aws eks create-cluster ]       ‚Üí creates control plane
[ aws eks create-nodegroup ]     ‚Üí adds worker nodes
[ aws eks update-kubeconfig ]    ‚Üí configures local access # this is the command that binds aws eks to kubectl
[ kubectl get nodes ]            ‚Üí talks to cluster via API
[ kubectl apply -f app.yaml ]    ‚Üí deploys workloads



Kubernetes PODs

Kubernetes has the goal of deploying apps in the form of containers on worker nodes that live inside a cluster

A pod is a single instance of an application

K8s does not deploy containers directly on worker nodes instead the container is encapsuleted into a Kubernetes object named POD
The goal is to deploy apps in the form of containers on worker nodes in a k8s cluster
K8s does not deploy containers to worker nodes.
Pods are the ones that are running the containers.
A pod is a single instance of an app
A **Pod does not have a fixed number of clients** it can handle.  
It depends entirely on **what‚Äôs running inside the container(s)** ‚Äî the **application logic**, **resources (CPU/RAM)**, and **traffic load**.
If your Pod runs **NGINX**, it can handle **hundreds or thousands** of clients (depending on configuration and hardware).
If your Pod runs a **small Flask app** with one worker process, it may handle only **a few concurrent requests**.
Two nginx containers in a single pod with the same purpose is not recomended.
You usually have **one main (unique) container** in a Pod,  
but you **can include other different containers** (sidecars) that assist it ‚Äî  
for logging, proxying, monitoring, or initialization tasks.
Helper containers or Sidecars are data pullers, data pushers (logs), proxies ( write static data to html files using Helper container and reads using main container)
Pod to container is a one to one relationship and share same storage space

The following command are imperative! Meaning that you write them through the CLI ( declarative means YAML files )



Using pods and checking inside
minikube start
minikube ip  # get ip adress of the control plane
kubectl get nodes -o wide  # if no pods exist, create pods

**In managed clouds ‚Üí the provider picks (always containerd)**
minikube ssh    # you can ssh into the minikube container  to see what is running the containers (dockerd, contanerd, CRI-o, etc)
	ps aux | grep containerd  # if containerd is used
	( you can start running images with other runtimes like:
	minikube start --container-runtime=containerd   or
    minikube start --container-runtime=docker )
	kubectl describe node | grep "Container Runtime Version"
	
	
Create pod:
	kubectl run running-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0  # image name
	kubectl describe pod runningpodv1
	kubectl exec -it runningpodv1 -- bash
	kubectl delete pod namepod

minikube status # to see if cluster has started
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl exec -it containerID -- sh  # to get the 
kubectl describe pod my-first-pod | grep State  # case sensitive because of YAML

Go inside the container and see what ports is Nginx running:
kubectl exec -it podname -- sh
Then inside container:
cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf | grep listen

Expose the POD:

kubectl expose pod my-first-pod \
  --type=NodePort \
  --port=80 \
  --target-port=80 \
  --name=nginx-service

kubectl get svc
minikube service nginx-service --url #  this will output the URL # minikube command is only for local testing of course -> use the next one for remote contexts
**kubectl port-forward service/nginx-service 8080:80**



Debug if needed 
If you need to debug the POD - OR use Ephemeral containers ( must read more )
This starts a **temporary container** inside the same pods network namespace ( not inside the bugged pod) that does_ include debugging tools:
kubectl debug pod/nameofbuggedPOD -it --image=busybox
ps aux
top
netstat -tulpn


Kubernetes Services = NodePort  ( service object is an endpoint for pods)

Creating a service means using kubectl expose podname --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=give-service-a-name
You can expose and app running on a set of PODs using different types of services 
Cluster IP # expose the actual cluster IP to the internet 

NodePort
	Exposes the service on each worker node's IP at a static port (nothing but NodePort)
	A ClusterIP Service to which the NodePort service routes is automatically created.
	Port Range 30000 - 32767
	Every service has it;s own port
		Cluster IP service port : 80

Kubernetes cluster:
	Worker Node
		POD
		SERVICE ( assigns the cluster IP service port to port: 80 and the target container Pod to targetPort: 80   This means the actual port mapping ipadress/80:80 !

YAML example of this:
	apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80          # Service Port
      targetPort: 80    # Pod container port
  type: ClusterIP

targetPort  -> Inside the Pod   ->  The port the container actually listens on.

port  ->  Inside the Service (ClusterIP)  ->  The port exposed inside the cluster. Other Pods use this.

nodePort   ->  On the Node (VM/host)  ->  The port opened on each worker node to reach the Service from outside the cluster.

Declarative example YAML: 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - port: 80          # (1) Service port
      targetPort: 8080  # (2) Pod's container port
      nodePort: 30080   # (3) Node's exposed port

External client
    ‚îÇ
    ‚ñº
NodeIP:30080            ‚Üê NodePort (worker node port) (exposed on the node at host-level)(This is the actual VM IP) Never use in production, only for testing and degubbing
    ‚îÇ
    ‚ñº
Service ClusterIP:80     ‚Üê internal virtual IP and port ( inside cluster meaning it's private)
    ‚îÇ
    ‚ñº
PodIP:8080               ‚Üê actual container port (container private IP)

If you had multiple worker nodes, **each one** opens the same NodePort (30080).  
Kubernetes (via kube-proxy) will route your request to one of the backend Pods, even if that Pod lives on another node.

Node1IP:30080
Node2IP:30080
Node3IP:30080

`ClusterIP` = internal only  
`NodePort` = local/external access via NodeIP:port  
`LoadBalancer` = cloud-level IP built on top of NodePorts

Kubernetes automatically wires up the NodePort on every node, even if the Pod isn‚Äôt there. That‚Äôs why we can curl either node‚Äôs public IP and still get the same webpage ‚Äî Kubernetes routes the traffic internally to wherever the Pod actually runs. This means that in order for kubernetes to not have dead adresses on the service, it routes existent but non working nodes to the ones that work. This way the client never runs into 404
If that Pod dies, kube-proxy removes it from the Service endpoints.  
When a new Pod starts (even on another node), the Service updates its routing instantly

Doing it:
Service gets created accoross the worker nodes, meaning that you can access the app on multiple worker node ports

kubectl run runningpodv1 --image imagenamefromDockerHub
kubectl expose pod runningpodv1 --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80
kubectl describe pod runningpodv1
kubectl get nodes -o wide   # this will expose 
kubectl get svc
minikube ip # to get the local minikube ip where the cluster is running
minikube service runningpodv1 # because of port forwarding in Win11, we create a tunnel for service that browser can use

- **`kubectl expose`** creates a Service object that maps the container‚Äôs internal port (80) to a node-level NodePort (for example 30381).
    
- **`minikube ip`** gives the IP of the Minikube VM that hosts the control plane and worker node(s).
    
- In **Windows 11 + WSL2**, the `192.168.49.x` network is isolated from the host,  
    so **`minikube service`** automatically creates a **localhost tunnel** (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`) that your Windows browser can access.


kubectl expose pod command variations:
kubectl expose pod runningpodv1 --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=runningpodv1-service # this assigns a new pod to the already RUNNING service!. You can delete pods, recreate and reasign so they do not remain orphan and exclude the recreation of the service itself


LoadBalancer(an entrypoint)  ( sits on top of Nodeport then nodeport sends to Cluser IP, cluster sends to Pods. You can either use NodePort as exposed public ( an IP adress, or let LoadBalancer do the work ) ) Every one of these is managed by Kubernetee Service


Pod Container access and logs:

	Get loggs from pods

	kubectl logs podname
	kubectl logs -f podname  #  You can stream loggs in the CLI to see them live:
	Executing commands:
	
	kubectl exec -it nginxpod -- bash  # this is to get inside bash shell container
	You can run commands into the container from outsite
	kubectl exec -it nginxpod ls
	kubectl exec -it nginxpod cat /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
	
	Get YAML outpus of Pod service
		kubectl get pod nginxpod -o yaml
		kubectl get service nginxpod -o yaml # you get the service of the pod
		kubectl get service -o yaml  # or get everything about service in YAML
kubectl get service nginxpod -o yaml | grep port # or grep whatever you want

Deleting stuff:
	kubectl get all  # see pods, services. etc
		kubectl delete pod podname
		kubectl delete svc servicename

Replica sets

Hogh availibiliry or realiability
Scaling
Loadbalancing
Labels and selectors

If a pod dies, ReplicaSet recreates the configured pod to ensure the configured no of pod running at any given time 

**ReplicaSets** ensure that a defined number of identical Pods are running simultaneously.  
For example, if it‚Äôs set to 3 replicas, Kubernetes keeps 3 Pods active at all times.  
If one Pod crashes or is deleted, the system automatically creates a new one to restore the total number of running Pods back to 3 (or whatever number is defined).
**ReplicaSet = Self-healing Pod controller**  
Keeps the desired number of Pods running by automatically replacing any that fail.


LoadBalancing: 

LoadBalancer (an entrypoint)  (sits on top of Nodeport then nodeport sends to Cluser IP, cluster sends to Pods. You can either use NodePort as exposed public ( an IP adress, or let LoadBalancer do the work ) ) Every one of these is managed by Kubernetee Service

Provides load balancing meaning that the client cannot overload traffic to a single pod.
K8s provide load balancing out of the box using Service for the pods which are part of a ReplicaSet
Labels & Selectors are the jey itmes which ties all 3 - Pod -> ReplicaSet -> Service
ReplicaSets can be over mode worker nodes!!!

Service distributes traffic through the ReplicaSet and then to the Pods present in that set
Bottom line is : 
- **ReplicaSet = quantity control (availability)**
    
- **Service = traffic control (load balancing)**

Scaling : When toe load becomes greater than the number of pods, k8s enables us to scale up our app adding additional pods as needed

You can scale manually or enable HorizontalPodAutoscaler

Replica Sets are only declarative though YAML manifests

Using replica sets:

First you create the YAML file in your project folder
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: my-helloworld-rs
  labels:
    app: my-helloworld
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-helloworld
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-helloworld-app
        image: stacksimplify/kube-helloworld:1.0.0
```
SERVICE IS NOT SELF HEALING # if you delete it, it will no be autocreated
```
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get rs
kubectl describe rs my-helloworld-rs
kubectl get pods # to see the pods created
kubectl get pods -o wide
kubectl get pods -o yaml
kubectl get pod podname -o yaml
kubectl get pods myhelloworld-rs-c8rrj -o yaml # get which replica set the pod belongs to

kubectl expose rs replicasetname --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=servicenametobecreated
kubectl port-forward svc/kodecolor-imperative-deploy-service 8080:80
kubectl get svc
kubectl get nodes -o wide # get worker nodes public IP

#Verify if the repocaset availibility feature is working
Update the replica sets from 3 to 6
kubectl replace -f replicaset-demo.yaml
kubectl get pods -o wide # see the new pods or not

#Delete replica sets
kubectl delete svc servicename # the pods will continue to be run(managed) by replicaset
#you can reattach the service to the pods
kubectl expose pod runningpodv1 --type=NodePort --port=80 --name=runningpodv1-service
kubectl get pods my-helloworld-rs-2zp2k -o yaml | grep -A 20 owner # grep first 20 lines after owner to you do not clog up the terminal


```

Expose replica set as a service.

Tunneling is for local bridging WSL2 to Windows browser:
```
kubectl expose rs my-helloworld-rs --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=8080 --name=my-helloworld-rs-service
kubectl get svc
kubectl port-forward svc/kodecolor-imperative-deploy-service 8080:80

now modify the replicas in the YAML file to 6 and then hit:
kubectl replace -f nameofyamlfile.yaml
kubectl get pods -o wide # to see if they got created

kubectl delete svc
kubectl get svc # to see if it got deleted
```


Deployments:
Deployments are a superset of replica set. Replica set is a small subset of the deployment features
You never need to create pods manually ‚Äî **ReplicaSets and Deployments do it implicitly from the Pod template.**
A **Deployment** is basically a **ReplicaSet manager** ‚Äî it wraps ReplicaSets and adds **version control, rollout management, and rollback capabilities** on top of them.
Whenever we create a deployment we rollout a replicaSet also
When using deployments you keep previous versions of the setup - You can rollback to older deployments or update, scale , pausing and resuming a deployment 
**Deployment ‚Üí manages ‚Üí ReplicaSet(s)**  but **not the other way around**.
It contains the last 10 versions of our application, or add more versions with .yaml files
Cleanup policy automated
Canary deployments ?

Creating a deployment the imperative way - through commands in CLI ( not YAML )

```
minikube start -p myclustername
kubectl config get-contexts
kubectl config set-context contextname

kubectl create deployment dploymentname --image=kodekloud/webapp-color
kubectl get deployments
kubectl describe deployment my-first-deployment
kubectl get rs
kubectl get po
kubectl scale --replicas=20 deployment/my-first-deployment
kubectl get deploy
kubectl get rs

kubectl scale --replicas=10 deployment/my-first-deployment 
kubectl get deploy
kubectl expose deployment my-first-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80 --target-port=80 --name=my-first-deployment-service

kubectl port-forward svc/kodecolor-imperative-deploy-service 8080:80 #WSL2 problem

# Get Public IP of Worker Nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide


```

Creating a deployment the declarative way ( YAML file )


Updating or editing deployments:
You can set a new image or edit the edployment

Update deployment Imperative way: 
```
kubectl get deployment deploymentname -o yaml

# check container name in YAML file
kubectl set image deployment/kubecolor-deployment containername=stacksimplify/kubenginx:2.0.0 # container name with kubectl describe pods | grep "Containers:"
# it is good to annotate to see history in rollout
kubectl annotate deployment kubecolor-deployment \ 
kubernetes.io/change-cause="Updated to Juice Shop v1 for demo"  # if you do not annotate the change you will not see the change in rollout history
kubectl annotate <resource-type>/<resource-name> <key>="<value>"

kubectl rollout history deployment/kubecolor-deployment 



kubectl rollout status deployment/my-first-deployment
kubectl describe deployment my-first-deployment
kubectl get rs
kubectl get po
kubectl rollout history deployment/deploymentname
kubectl port-forward svc/kodecolor-imperative-deploy-service 8080:80 #WSL2 problem
kubectl port-forward svc/kubecolor-deployment 9090:3000 # 9090 will be the targer for the browser and 3000 is the target for the container app


```

Edit the deployment Declarative way:

```
# With kubectl edit you can get inside the declared YAML file in K8s
kubectl edit deployment/my-first-deployment
# opens with VIM. kubectl edit is just for testing, should no be used in production. You do not have a version control of this and if you mess something up there will be no track of it.
# kubectl rollout history deployment kubecolor-deployment  # If you use kubectl edit, the changes are not registered anythere, neither in rollouts

# Change From 2.0.0
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: stacksimplify/kubenginx:2.0.0

# Change To 3.0.0
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: stacksimplify/kubenginx:3.0.0
        
        #bellow the image setting for the new image
        
kubectl get deployment kodecolor-imperative-deploy -o yaml | grep name:  # to get container name where to insert the image

# the trigger for the image replacement is the kubectl set image  command itself. 
kubectl set image deployment/kodecolor-imperative-deploy webapp-color=stacksimplify/kubenginx:2.0.0
# kubectl rollout is just a short log
kubectl rollout status deployment/kodecolor-imperative-deploy



```
If you did the annotations correct when if we hit:

kubectl rollout history resource/deploymentname  # you should see the numbers of revisions. Choose the suitable that we want to roll back to!!! Not the one you want to remove

kubectl rollout history deployment/kubecolor-deployment # now you have rolled back to that particular state

kubectl rollout undo deployment/kubecolor-deployment --to-revision=3 # you remove the current version and change to revision 3 / You cannot execute this commmand if there was no previous command to undo

TO restart the while application:
kubectl rollout restart deployment/deploymentname
kubectl get pods

Pausing and resuming deployments

# If we want to make multiple deployments we can pause the deployment and make changes and resume

kubectl rollout pause
kubectl rollout resume
kubectl get endpoints myapp-service

kubectl delete deploy nameofdeploy
kubectl delete svc svcname

Kubernetes services

Cluster IP - used for comunication inside the cluster # frontend to backend for example
NodePort - Access apps outside of K8s using Worker node ports
LoadBalancer - AWS elastic load balancer
Intress - Advanced load balancer, SSL, etc de invatat
externalName - To access externally hosted apps or databases inside you k8s cluster. DNS name  de invatat cum functioneaza

YAML FILES -> The declarative way that is good for keepind track of versioning

# the base definition of a resource in K8s
Tipycal resources to be created: Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service
```
apiVersion: v1        # string
kind: Pod             # string
metadata:             # dicitonary - contains more pairs
  name: my-yaml-pod
  labels:
    app: my-yaml-app-v1
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-app-containername  # the container name that is is used when setting the image in rollouts
	  image: repo/imagename   # image name in dockerhub
	  ports:
	    - containerPort: 80
```
apiVersion: V1   # V1 is the core Kubernetes API for basic objects like pods, services, ConfigMaps ( deployments use V1 )
kind: Service    #defines what type of resource you are creating
metadata:
  name: my-yaml-app-v1-service   # the unique name of your serrvice (can be annotations, labels, names)
spec:                 #defines behavior or configuration of this service

  selector:           
    app: my-yaml-app-v1  # api version keeps depending on what you want to build
  ports:
    - name: http # assign a name to a port for easy identify
      port: 80  #service port exposed outsite
      targetPort: 80  # the container port targeted in the cluster and further into the pod ( where the container lives)
      nodePort: 31231  #underneath the nodePort there is the above targetPort

# pods forward all container data tot the cluster
# all containers in the POD share the same IP # if the containers listens in port 80, the Pod itself also listens on 80
# You do not need NAT or explicit port firwarding betweeen pods (k8s handles this through CNI - Container network interface)

# A Pod runs containers and provides a network endpoint to access them from within the cluster

USING YAML files
```
The context selector before applying so you do not destroy some other cluster
kubectl config current-context 
kubectl config use-context  # context are a combination of cluster+user(credentials) + namespace - Only one cluster at a time!!! Namespaces can overlap multuple clusters and/or resources

kubectl config create-context # if you need a new context - contexts are logical mappings or resources - just a saved connection profile inside your kube configuration -> When I use this context, talk to that cluster, as this user, in this namespace.
kubectl config set-context   # With this you can set a context to another user and combine resources. A new context can map a resource like a cluster to a user and a namespace so you can let in someone else to work on that cluster - a context is just linking setting that already exist. 

kubectl config use-context contextname # to switch to other context names
kubectl create name-of-yaml.yaml # this commands only creates new resources - does not update old ones
kubectl apply -f name-of-yaml.yaml  # Updates existing resources

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod-nodeport-service 
spec:
  type: NodePort 
  selector: #only to those puds under the selector the traffic will be routed!
    app: myapp 
  ports: 
    - name: http
      port: 80 # Service Port
      targetPort: 80 # Container Port
      nodePort: 31231 # NodePort


How the app name gets declared from one script to another

# Deployment (creates Pods)
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp        # Must match Pod label
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp      # Pods get this label


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp          # Must match Pod label again
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80  # port inside container

```

Deployment
  ‚Üì
ReplicaSet
  ‚Üì
Creates Pods using template:
   - metadata.labels = app: myapp
   - spec.containers[0].image = nginx:latest
  ‚Üì
Service
   - selector.app = myapp  (targets Pods)
   - spec.ports:
        - port: 80
          targetPort: 80
          nodePort: 31231 (if NodePort type)
  ‚Üì
Ingress (optional)
   - routes HTTP(S) traffic to Service
   - spec.rules.host = myapp.example.com
   - spec.backend.service.name = myapp-service



The Deployment defines the Pod template, the ReplicaSet ensures Pods exist, the Service connects users to those Pods, and the Ingress (if used) exposes them externally

template = Pod template
It defines what each Pod should look like when the controller (Deployment or ReplicaSet) creates it.

tier is not a Kubernetes object or isolation boundary ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a label.
But it‚Äôs incredibly useful as a logical grouping tag for your resources.


EKS
How does a POD comunicate with other AWS services?
PIA - Pod Identity Agent - go to addons and install pod identity agent

You need a pod deployed in EKS, and assign an IAM role to it ( practically create a user with IAM permission to manage pod )
0. We are going to create a pod identity assiciation - a simple CLI pod # the pod will run on each and every node on the cluster
1. The IAM role will have read only permissions to S3 for example
2. We are going to install PIM -> Then Create a service account for CLI Pod
3. In which namespace the workload is running?

You need to restart the pod in order for the permissions to take effect
aws s3 list ( will work after pod restart )
Eks pod identity association (PIA) works for Dynamo, EBS and other services

Installing EKS PIA ( pod identity association ) 
You practically create a pod inside all the worker nodes ( you can actually se a pod with a agent name when kubectl get pods -n namespace or kubectl get daemonset -n namespace )

It is a Daemon that handles authentication of services and lives in a simple pod inside each worker node in the cluster
kubectl get daemonset -n namespacename
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
eks-pod-identity-agent  will be present in the list - it runs on each k8s worker node after install
kubectl	get pods -o wide

In the YAML files you have the namespace defined : default
Run the YAML files that create the service account:

ServiceAccount is another Kubernetes ( or EKS ) object that lives inside the cluster‚Äôs control plane, not in your nodes or containers.
A Service account is to a pod what a username is to a person. The pod authenticates to the API server


EBS volumes 
EBS provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 and container instances
We can mount these drives as devices on out EC2 and container instances
EBS volumes that are attached to an EC2 persist independently from the life of the EC2 container instance
We can dinamically change the config of a volume attached to an instance ( increase/decrease size etc ) - works for databases for short and long reads of service

For Cluster IP service, the following will live inside :
Storage class
Persistent Volume Claim
ConfigMap
Env Variables
Volumes
Volume mounts
Node port for local

FOr User management we create a NodePort Service

Node Port service
Deployment
Env variables 

CSI drive: CSI stands for Container Storage Interface ‚Äî
a standard API that allows Kubernetes to talk to any storage backend (AWS, GCP, Ceph, etc.) through a plug-in driver.

üß± Pod is running

```
The EBS volume is attached and mounted to that node.
The application writes data into /data, which goes to EBS.
Pod dies / Node drained
Kubernetes terminates the Pod.
The EBS CSI driver detaches the volume from that EC2 node.
Replica / new Pod scheduled
The controller (Deployment, StatefulSet) spins up a new Pod (often on another node).
The CSI driver sees that this Pod uses the same PVC.
It attaches the same EBS volume to the new node.
The volume is remounted inside the new Pod at /data.
Application continues
```

The new Pod now sees all previous data ‚Äî files, databases, etc. ‚Äî intact.

EBS volumes are ReadWriteOnce (RWO), meaning they can only be attached to one node at a time.
So if you have multiple replicas, only one Pod can use that volume simultaneously.
For shared access, you‚Äôd use EFS (Elastic File System) instead.
The driver handles: AWS API calls: AttachVolume, DetachVolume, DeleteVolume
Node mount paths and filesystem integrity
The delay between Pod death and new Pod readiness = time for AWS to detach + attach (~5‚Äì20 seconds).

Installing EBS CSI driver:
Go to EKS cluster (name of your cluster) - Addons - EBS CSI driver -> Addon access is EKS Pod Identity -> Create recomended role ( sends you to IAM ) -> EKS pof Identity -> Create role  - Go to Roles and see what we created. Now we have Pod identity - must have Active status

kubectl get pods -n namespacename
You shold see ebs-csi in front of nodes

DaemonSet is a controller that manages system-level Pods which run services on every node in the cluster
kubectl get ds -n nameofnamespace  # this gets Daemonsets in the namespace
With this command you are seeing real Pods that are running on your worker nodes, just like your own application Pods. The pods are system-level Pods, managed by DaemonSets

A DaemonSet is a Kubernetes controller that ensures one Pod runs on every node (or on a selected subset of nodes).
It‚Äôs used for workloads that need to:
collect logs, metrics, or monitor nodes
provide node-level system services
mount or manage node-local storage or networking


kubectl get endpoints myapp-service
